This project is my Project I for Bachelor's program in Winter 2021 Semester.

## Summary
Naive Bayes (NB) is a supervised machine learning classification model. The mathematical foundation behind NB is Bayes's Theorem, which describes the likelihood of an event given observations using conditional probability. In the project, two Naive Bayes models were implemented for two types of explanatory variables. The former is Categorical NB for nominal categorical variables, and the latter is Gaussian NB for numeric continous ones, given that these variables follow normal distribution. The project was implemented with Python using NumPy and SciPy libraries. Experiments with there datasets Iris [1], Breast Cancer [2], and Wine [3] were carried out. Predictions of the implemented Naive Bayes (NB) showed the compatibility with Scikit-Learn Naive Bayes model [4].
