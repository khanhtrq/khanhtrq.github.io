This project is a part of my AI training program in 2022 at [Computer Vision Lab](https://bkai.ai/research/cv-team/), The International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (BK.AI), Hanoi University of Science and Technology. It was supervised by one member of Computer Vision Lab.

## Summary

A satellite image time series (SITS) is a sequence of signals of a geographic area taken by a satellite at different times. SITS classification is widely applied to study and monitor enviroment, agriculture, and climate. Due to changes in environmental conditions, such as weather and seasonal changes, leveraging temporal data is necessary for accurate classification [1]. This project aimed at employing pattern recognition techniques to classify time-series data into land cover types. In particular, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) were applied to classify Sentinel-1 SITS into five types of land cover, namely Crop, Forest, Rice, Urban, and Water. The highest accuracies of 1D-CNN and RNN models are 84.2% and 85.9%, respectively.

<!-- In some cases, classification using single image is not enough because of random noise is generated from sensors or environment. This small project is an example for student(s) to know how to apply pattern recognition techniques on time-series data (https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-time-series-classification-algorithms-7b4284d31b97). In this project, student will use extracted/pre-prepared time-series data (3 different bands) from Sentinel-1 images to classify pixels to land cover types
 - Plot some sample time-series to see why pattern recognition is needed
 - Apply ML algorithm(s) to classify pixels using single bands
 - Apply ML algorithm(s) to solve the problem using multiple bands
 - Analyse/ Report results  

Note: Detailed instructions and sample codes (if needed) will be provided by the supervisor. Student can read some tutorials in advance
