<p>A small place to know me a little more, personally.</p>

<p>
    📖 Scrolling social media is fun, but have you ever found yourself in a <b>book</b>?<br>

    🏃‍♂️ <b>Running</b> reminds me that a thousand-mile journey always begins with a single step.<br>

    👫 I'm an introvert. But I also enjoy <b>meeting people</b>, who knows a "Where are you from" can lead us!<br>

    🌳 I'm a <b>nature lover</b>. 🪴 Gardening bring a little into my house.<br>

    🧠 I enjoy <b>learning new things</b>, just to enhance my neuroplasticity.<br>

    ✈️ <b>Travelling</b> is a way to see the world 🌍 from different perspectives.<br>

    <!-- The things that I enjoy doing: 
      Keep going! You'll be amazed by how far you have gone.
    [Mindfulness] Enjoy little things, trauma experience
    , even when things get tough <br> -->
