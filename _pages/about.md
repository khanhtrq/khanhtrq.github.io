I have recently completed my Bachelor's study in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [School of Information and Communication Technology (SoICT)](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam.

During my Barchelor's study, I had the opportunity to study one exchange semester at [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/), Germany, with support from *Erasmus+ Programme*, and later did five-month research attachment at [Singapore Institute of Manufactoring Technology (SIMTech)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech), supported by [*Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (SIPGA)*](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-undergraduate-studies/singapore-international-pre-graduate-award-sipga). At SoICT, I was an undergraduate reserch student at Computer Vision Lab, [The International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (BK.AI)](bkai.ai).

My research experience was on modeling and computer vision, particularly on multi-domain learning, domain adaptation, and multi-view action recognition. As a nature-lover, I am interested in graduate study on the interdisciplinary of modeling and artificial intelligence with applications on sustainability.


With a love about nature, I am interested in the interdisciplinary applications of modeling and artificial intelligence in sustainability. 

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary of Modeling, Simulation and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the context of sustainability and climate.
