I have recently completed my Bachelor's study in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [School of Information and Communication Technology (SoICT)](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam. During my study, I had the opportunity to study one exchange semester at [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/), Germany, with support from *Erasmus+ Programme*.

At Computer Vision Lab, [The International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (BK.AI)](https://bkai.ai/), SoICT, I am currently working as an undergraduate reserch student on a research project collaborated with two institutes of [French Armed Forces Health Services](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/sante). Previously, I did five-month research attachment at [Singapore Institute of Manufactoring Technology (SIMTech)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech), supported by *Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (SIPGA)*. 

In addition to my interest in Computer Vision, such as Multi-Domain Learning and Domain Adaptation, I am also fascinated by the interdisciplinary field of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Modeling with specific applications on sustainability.

I want to write about my passion, patience, to go beyond here. I had the ideas when taking shower, but right now, my mind seems to be tired. I need take to think about it. 

During my Barchelor's study, I had the opportunity to study one exchange semester at [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/), Germany, with support from *Erasmus+ Programme*, and 

[How about writing about my research experience in modeling here?] In addtion to my expertise in Computer Vision, e.g. multi-domain learning, domain adaptation, multi-view action recognition, I also had research experiecne in agent-based modeling? 

- Undergraduate research student  

To mention: 
- Supported by Erasmus+ program.  
- SIPGA Awards.  

My research experience was on modeling and computer vision, particularly on multi-domain learning, domain adaptation, and multi-view action recognition. As a nature-lover, I am interested in graduate study on the interdisciplinary of modeling and artificial intelligence with applications on sustainability.


With a love about nature, I am interested in the interdisciplinary applications of modeling and artificial intelligence in sustainability. 

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary of Modeling, Simulation and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the context of sustainability and climate.
