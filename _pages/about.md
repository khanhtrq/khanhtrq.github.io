I have recently completed my Bachelor's study in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [School of Information and Communication Technology (SoICT)](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam. During my study, I had the opportunity to study one exchange semester at [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/), Germany, with support from *Erasmus+ Programme*.

At Computer Vision Lab, [The International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (BK.AI)](https://bkai.ai/), SoICT, I am currently working as an undergraduate reserch student on a research project collaborated with two institutes of [French Armed Forces Health Services](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/sante). Previously, I did five-month research attachment at [Singapore Institute of Manufactoring Technology (SIMTech)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech), supported by *Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (SIPGA)*. 

Currently, my interested areas include (1) **Generalization for Computer Vision**, such as Multi-Domain Learning, Multi-View Learning, Domain Adaptation, (2) interesction of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Multi-Agent (Intelligent) System**, and **(Agent-Based) Modeling**, and (3) it's applications to **sustainability** and **climate change**.

Besides my interest in Generalization for Computer Vision, including Multi-Domain Learning, Multi-View Learning, Domain Adaptation, I am also fascinated by the interdisciplinary field of Artificial Intelligence and Agent-Based Modeling with specific applications on sustainability and climate change.  

Looing back

I'm actively looking for graduate study (MSc, PhD) positions for the upcoming academic year.  

[Show my passion, attitute toward difficulties here!] 
[Show my journey, how far I have gone! Sometime how far I have gone is more important than where I am.]  [Be straight, concise, and clear] [Do not be lengthy, flowery.]  
Growing up from a small town in poor area of Northern Vietnam, I was fortunate to be encouraged to persue my science journey at a young age. With my experience, I am aware that the long journey always begins with little courage to take the first step. I am open to new challenges as opportunities to develop.

Looking back my journey, I see that where I am now is the result of courage to take a small first step and perserverance to keep going. I am open to challenges as opportunities to grow. (I know that when I am struggling is when I am growing!) I belive in my potential to achieve that things I want, it is achieveble when I spend enough time!   

I want to write about my passion, patience, to go beyond here. I had the ideas when taking shower, but right now, my mind seems to be tired. I need take to think about it. 

With a love about nature, I am interested in the interdisciplinary applications of modeling and artificial intelligence in sustainability.
