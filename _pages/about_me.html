<p>A small place to know me a little more, personally. ☕🥐
<h2>What I enjoy doing:</h2>
    Scrolling social media is fun, but have you ever found yourself in a <b>book</b> 📚?<br>

    <b>Running</b> 🏃‍♂️ reminds me that a thousand-mile journey always begins with a single step.<br>

    I'm an introvert. But I also enjoy <b>meeting people</b> 👩‍🎓🧑🏻‍🌾👩🏾‍🚀, who knows a "Where are you from?" can lead us!<br>

    I enjoy <b>learning new things</b> 🧠, just to enhance my neuroplasticity.<br>

    I enjoy several kinds of <b>writing</b> ✒️. I find my mind clear by putting thoughts into words.<br>

    I'm a nature lover 🌳. <b>Gardening</b> 🪴 brings a little into my house.<br>

    <b>Travelling</b> ✈️ is my way to see the world 🌍 from different perspectives.<br>

<h2>Some of my favourites:</h2>
    My favourite letter is <b>German Smiley Ü</b> (U-umlaut). It always smiles 😊. <br>

    A <b>rainbow</b> 🌈 is always stunning, no matters how many times I have seen. It's a reminder that I am not a single color, but the whole spectrum.
